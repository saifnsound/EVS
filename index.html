        Many factors affect the concentration of dissolved oxygen in water. Some of these are salinity (which depends on the type
        of water body),plant growth in that region(chlorophyll content) and temperature of the water.
        <br>
        <br> This application shows the dependency of dissolved oxygen in water on the temperature of the water body and its
        chlorophyll content separately.
